      toc_paragraph_1:
        section_1a: 
          1.(a) That the total vehicle price set out above is the price of the vehicle
          based on existing costs and circumstances. If there is any change in 
          those costs or circumstances before delivery of the vehicle to me, you
          may increase the total vehicle price payable by me. If you increase
          the price of the vehicle (and unless I take delivery of the vehicle or
          such increase results only from a change in any applicable statutory
          charge) I may cancel the contract arising from your acceptance of this
          order ("the contract") by notifying you in writing of my intention to
          do so at anytime within three (3) days after the receipt of
          notification of such increase.
        section_1a_note: 
          "Note: If the vehicle is of unusual design or combines unusual options the
          parties may, by signing this Clause in the space provided below, agree that 
          the Clause 1(a) shall not apply. We agree that Clause 1(a) does not apply."
        section_1b:
          (b) To take delivery of the vehicle at your address above within seven (7) 
          days from your notifying me that the vehicle is available for delivery to 
          me failing which you may cancel the contract.  You are to use your best 
          endeavours to make the vehicle available for delivery on or about the 
          estimated delivery date but you are not to be  responsible for any delay 
          or failure to do so. If you do not notify me that the vehicle is available
          for delivery to me for  more than sixty (60) days for new goods and thirty
          (30) days for second hand goods, after the estimated delivery date, I may 
          cancel the contract.
        section_1c:
          (c) That on or before taking delivery of the vehicle I shall pay to you the 
          balance payable as above and shall deliver the trade-in (if any) to you and 
          shall assign to you the benefit of its existing registration and insurance. 
          If at the time of delivery of the trade-in to you the amount required to 
          discharge any debt or security on the trade-in is more or less than the 
          trade-in pay out shown in the Schedule, you may adjust the balance payable 
          set out in the Schedule to allow for the difference.
        section_1d:
          (d) If the trade-in is not at the time of its delivery to you in substantially 
          the same condition as at the date hereof, fair wear and tear and reasonable 
          daily mileage only excepted, you will be entitled to reduce the trade-in 
          price shown in the Schedule by a reasonable amount having regard to the 
          deterioration in the trade-in or return the trade-into me and demand payment 
          from me for any additional balance due as a result of adding the trade-in 
          price back to the balance payable in the Schedule or you may cancel this 
          contract and retain the vehicle without incurring any liability to me.
        section_1e:
          (e) That until the balance payable shown in the Contract has been paid to 
          you and you have received clear title to any trade-in, no interest in the 
          vehicle shall pass to me. If the vehicle is delivered to me before payment 
          has been made and title given, I shall have possession of the vehicle on 
          as bailee only notwithstanding that I may have made an application for 
          credit or that you may have resold the trade-in. Whilst bailee thereof, I 
          shall not part with possession of and shall be responsible for any damage 
          to or loss of the vehicle. You may terminate such bailment at any time by 
          sending by ordinary post notice in writing to me at my address above and 
          forthwith re-take possession.
        section_1f:
          (f) That if I fail to punctually observe and perform all my obligations 
          hereunder all moneys paid and/or any trade-in provided by way of deposit 
          shall be absolutely forfeited to you provided however that such forfeiture 
          shall not exceed 10% of the total vehicle price and you shall refund to me 
          the amount by which the cash deposit and/or the realised value of any 
          trade-in exceeds such percentage or recover from me an amount representing 
          10% of the total price of goods as liquidated damage for breach.
        section_1g:
          (g) Should the contract be cancelled pursuant to Clause 1(a), (b), (c) or 
          (d) all moneys paid by me shall be refunded. If the trade-in (if any) has 
          been delivered to you before cancellation of the contract and at the time 
          of cancellation the trade-in is
        section_1h:
          (h) still your property, you shall return the trade-in to me subject to 
          the payment by me to you of the reasonable cost of any repairs or 
          improvements effected by to the trade-in, or (ii) no longer your property, 
          you shall pay to me the realised value of the trade-in. For the purposes 
          of the contract the realised value of the trade-in shall mean the amount 
          for which the trade-in is sold by you to a bona fide purchaser for value 
          less - (A)% of the amount and 1(B) the reasonable cost of any repairs or 
          improvements effected by you to the trade-in.
